# Advanced URL Dispatching

In this section, we will explore advanced techniques for URL dispatching in Django. We will cover various strategies to enhance the way URLs are managed and routed in your Django applications.

## URLconf Tricks {#urlconf-tricks}

### Including Other URLconfs

* Modularizing your project using `include()`.
* Handling URL namespaces to avoid naming collisions across apps.

```python
from django.urls import path, include
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('song/', include('song.urls', namespace='song')),
    path('feedback/', include('feedback.urls', namespace='feedback')),
]
```

### Naming Patterns for Easier Reverse Lookups

Naming your URL patterns allows you to reference them easily throughout your project. This is particularly useful when you need to generate URLs dynamically in templates or views.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('article/<int:id>/', views.article_detail, name='article-detail'),
]
```

You can then use the `reverse` function or the `{% url %}` template tag to generate URLs:

```python
from django.urls import reverse
url = reverse('article-detail', args=[article.id])
```

### Passing Extra Options to View Functions

You can pass additional options to your view functions directly from the URLconf. This is useful for customizing behavior based on the URL pattern.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('archive/<int:year>/', views.archive, {'month': None}, name='archive'),
    path('archive/<int:year>/<int:month>/', views.archive, name='archive-month'),
]
```

## Getting Started with Django { #getting-started-with-django }

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

- Install the latest version of Django using pip, the Python package manager

```bash
pip install django
```

- Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate your Django project dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
```

This creates and activates a [virtual environment](../unit-1/virtual-environment.md) named `myenv`.

This makes other commands available only within this isolated environment.

Verify the installation by checking the Django version

```bash
django-admin --version
```

e.g. `django-admin` command-line utility is used to create and manage Django projects and applications.

### Starting a Project

Run the following command to create a new Django project named `geetshala`:

```bash
django-admin startproject geetshala
```

- `manage.py` file - command-line utility for managing the project
- `settings.py` file - configuration settings for the project
- `urls.py` file - URL routing for the project
- `wsgi.py` file - entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve the project

### Running the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

```bash
django-admin runserver
```

### Default SQLite Database

- Django uses SQLite as the default database as a lightweight, file-based database that requires minimal setup
- suitable for development and small-scale applications

??? tip "Mini-Challenge: Where is the configuration for SQLite Database?"

    The SQLite database file is typically located in the root directory of your Django project and is named `db.sqlite3` by default.

---

??? tip "Let the World Know What You Have Built!"

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

---

### Dissecting the Django Project Structure

```plaintext
geetshala/
    manage.py
    geetshala/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
        asgi.py
```

- The outer `geetshala/` directory is the project root directory
- `manage.py` - A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways
- The inner `geetshala/` directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you will need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. `geetshala.settings`).
- `__init__.py` - An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
- `settings.py` - Settings/configuration for this Django project
- `urls.py` - The URL declarations for this Django project; a "table of contents" of your Django-powered site
- `wsgi.py` - An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project
- `asgi.py` - An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project

#### [Project and App Structure](project-and-app-structure.md)

---

### Architectural Design Pattern

---

#### The MTV Architecture

- Model-Template-View architecture, a variation of the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern

* **Model(M)** - Data layer, handles data and database interactions

  Artists, Albums, Songs

- **View(V)** - Business logic layer, processes user requests, interacts with the model, and selects the appropriate template for rendering

  Displaying a list of songs, particular song, processing a form submission

- **Template(T)** - Presentation layer, manages the user interface and presentation logic

Displaying different components for same song for logged-in users and anonymous users

---

#### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle

- Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system
- A software development principle aimed at reducing repetition of code and promoting reusability

##### 🏗️ Example of DRY in Django

- Reusable components like models, views, and templates
- creating a single template for Artist information and reusing it across different views
- Template inheritance - define a base template and extend it for specific pages with common elements

---

---

## MVC Design Pattern

- A software design pattern for developing web applications
- three main components: Model, View, and Controller

---

---

## Dynamic Web Pages

- static web pages - same content for every user
- dynamic web pages - content changes based on user interactions, preferences, or other factors

## Dynamic Content

- generated on-the-fly based on user requests and interactions
- personalized user experiences, real-time data updates, and interactive features
- examples - social media feeds, e-commerce product recommendations, news websites

- **View** - processes user requests, retrieves data from the **model**, and selects the appropriate **template** for rendering dynamic content

## How Django Processes a Request

![how-django-processes-a-request](..//unit-1/assets/how-django-processes-a-request.png)

- Example of a user requesting a web page from a Django application `/songs`

![django-invalid-url-requests](../unit-1/assets/invalid-url.png)
??? tip "Mini-Challenge: What happens when an invalid URL is requested?"

    When an invalid URL is requested, Django returns a 404 Not Found error page, indicating that the requested resource could not be found on the server.

??? tip "Mini-Challenge: What is the sequence of steps Django takes to process a request?"

    1. User sends a request to `/songs`
    2. Django's URL dispatcher matches the URL to a view function
    3. The view function retrieves data from the model (e.g., list of songs)
    4. The view selects a template and passes the data to it
    5. The template renders the HTML with dynamic content
    6. Django sends the rendered HTML back to the user's browser

??? tip "Mini-Challenge: Resolve this issue - The requested URL /songs was not found on this server."

    - App Registration: Ensure that the app containing the `/songs` view is registered in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `settings.py`.
    - URL Configuration: Verify that the URL pattern for `/songs` is correctly defined in the `urls.py` file of the project or app.
    - View Function: Check that the view function handling the `/songs` request is properly implemented and returns a valid HTTP response.

## Mapping URLs to Views

- URL routing system maps incoming URL requests to specific view functions or classes
- URL patterns defined in the `urls.py` file

## Uniform Resource Locator - URLs

- fundamental mechanism for locating resources on the web
- A reference (an address) to a resource on the Internet
- structured string that specifies the location of a resource and the protocol used to access it

Structure of a URL:

```plaintext
scheme://domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id
```

| **Part** | **Description**                                               | **Example**            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Scheme   | The protocol to use (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).                      | https://               |
| Hostname | The domain name or IP address of the server.                  | www.example.com        |
| Port     | The network port (optional; 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).      | :8000 (in development) |
| Path     | The specific location of the resource on the server.          | /products/detail/15/   |
| Query    | Additional parameters passed to the server (key-value pairs). | ?sort=price&limit=10   |
| Fragment | An internal section of the resource (not sent to server).     | #section-header        |

**Example**
In a Django application, the part you primarily define is the Path:

URL: `https://127.0.0.1:8000/songs/2025/`

Path: `/songs/2025/`

### URLconfs and Loose Coupling

- URLconfs - URL configurations that map URL patterns to view functions or classes
- loose coupling between URL structure and view logic

URLconfs (The Map)
A URLconf is a Python list named urlpatterns containing path() definitions.

`geetshala/urls.py`(Project-level URLconf)

```python
# Project-level URLconf: routes to 'admin/' and the 'songs' app
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('songs/', include('songs.urls')),  # Include URLs from the songs app
]
```

`songs/urls.py` (App-level URLconf)

```python
# App-level URLconf: routes to specific views within the songs app
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.song_list, name='song_list'),  # e.g., /songs/
    path('<int:song_id>/', views.song_detail, name='song_detail'),  # e.g., /songs/1/
]
```

##### Loose Coupling

- a design principle that promotes separation of concerns
- the `urlpatterns` in `urls.py` files are decoupled from the actual view logic
- allows for easier maintenance and scalability of the application

**Benefit Example**

- `/songs/123/` can be routed to a view function `maintenance-mode.html` that displays a maintenance message without changing the URL structure.

- `/songs/123/` can be changed to `/geet/123/` to display the same song details without modifying the underlying view logic.

### Dynamic URLs

- URLs that contain variable parts
- allows a single URL pattern in `urls.py` to handle multiple requests with different parameters

```python
  # songs/urls.py

  from django.urls import path
  from . import views

  urlpatterns = [
    # Captures an integer (int:song_id)
    path('<int:song_id>/', views.song_detail, name='detail'),
  ]

```

**How it works**
When a user visits `/songs/543/hello-world/`, Django extracts `543` as `song_id` , passing it to the `song_detail` view function. And calls the view like this: `song_detail(request, song_id=543)`.

```python
# songs/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def song_detail(request, song_id):
    # The arguments (song_id) are passed directly from the URLconf
    response_text = f"You are viewing Song ID: {song_id}"
    return HttpResponse(response_text)
```

## Django’s Pretty Error

- pretty error pages during development
- detailed error messages with stack traces and debugging information
- project is in DEBUG mode (`DEBUG = True` in `settings.py`)

**Key Features of the Pretty Error Page**

- **Stack Trace**: shows the sequence of function calls that led to the error
- **Code Context**: provides a snippet of code around the line where the error occurred, helping to identify the issue
- **Variable Inspection**: allows inspection of local variables at the point of error
- **Request Information**: displays details about the HTTP request that caused the error, including headers and GET/POST data
- **Settings Overview**: shows relevant settings from `settings.py` that might affect the error

??? tip "Mini-Challenge: What happens in PRODUCTION?"

    - ⚠️ Security Note: Sensitive Information Might Be Exposed
    - Set `DEBUG = False` in production server. Django will send a generic HTTP 500 error page to the user and log the detailed error internally.

## ❓ 404 Errors (Page Not Found)

- occurs when a user requests a URL that does not exist in the application
- Django returns a 404 Not Found error page
- customizable 404 error page to provide a better user experience

**Handling 404 Errors in Django**

- URL Resolution: Ensure that the requested URL is correctly defined in the `urls.py` file
- View Logic: Verify that the view function handling the request is properly implemented and returns a valid HTTP response
- Custom 404 Page: Create a custom 404 error template (e.g., `404.html`) and configure Django to use it by setting `handler404` in the project's `urls.py` file

```python
  # geetshala/urls.py
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path
  from django.conf.urls import handler404
  from . import views
  urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
  ]
  handler404 = 'geetshala.views.custom_404_view'
```

```python
  # geetshala/views.py
  from django.http import HttpResponse

  def custom_404_view(request, exception):
    return HttpResponse("Custom 404 - Trying to render a page", status=404)
```

## The Django Template System

---

- DTS is Django's built-in mechanism for generating HTML, XML, or other text-based formats
- separates the presentation layer(how the data looks) from the business logic(how the data is processed) adhering to the MVT architecture

### 🎨 Using the Template System

- objective of the having a separation of data logic from presentation.
- creating template files (usually .html) that contain static HTML mixed with dynamic placeholders using tags, variables, and filters.

**Template Hierarchy and Location**

- default directory for templates is `templates/` within each app directory
- alternatively, define a global `templates/` directory at the project level and configure it in `settings.py`

```python
    # mysite/settings.py

    TEMPLATES = [
      {
        ...
        'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'], # Points to project_root/templates/
        ...
    },
  ]
```

#### 🔖 Basic Template Tags and Filters

- **Variables({{...}})**: placeholders for dynamic content, enclosed in double curly braces `{{ }}`

```html
<h1>{{ song.title }}</h1>
<p>Artist: {{ song.artist.name }}</p>
<p>Comment: {{ song.comments.1 }}</p>
```

- **Template Tags**: control flow, loops, and conditional logic

| Tag                     | Purpose                                                  | Example                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `{% if ... %}`          | Conditional statements.                                  | `{% if user.is_authenticated %}`                    |
| `{% for ... %}`         | Loops over iterable objects.                             | `{% for song in songs %}`                           |
| `{% csrf_token %}`      | Security tag, required in all POST forms.                | `<form method="post">{% csrf_token %}</form>`       |
| `{% url 'name' arg1 %}` | Looks up a URL by its defined name, avoiding hardcoding. | `<a href="{% url 'song:detail' song.id %}">...</a>` |

How to use it in templates:

```html
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
<p>Welcome, {{ user.username }}!</p>
{% else %}
<p>Please log in.</p>
{% endif %}
```

```html
{% for song in songs %}
<h2>{{ song.title }}</h2>
<p>Artist: {{ song.artist.name }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

??? tip "Mini-Challenge: Set up Link to Details page in List of Songs and to List of Songs in Details Page"

    Use the `{% url %}` tag to create a link to the song detail page dynamically.

    ```html
    <a href="{% url 'song_detail' song.geet_id %}">View Details</a>
    ```

- **Template Filters**: modify the display of variables (e.g., formatting dates, converting text to uppercase)

* Filters are applied using the pipe `|` symbol.

* Filter - date, default, length, safe

* `{{ song.release_date | date:"F j, Y" }}`
* `{{ name              | default:"Anonymous" }}`
* `{{ comments          | length }}`
* `{{ html_content      | safe }}`

```html
<p>Current date: {{ current_date|date:"F j, Y" }}</p>
<p>Uppercase Name: {{ user.username|upper }}</p>
```

### Templates in Views(context of MVT)

??? tip "Mini-Challenge: What is the role of View?"

    - processes user requests
    - retrieves data from the Model
    - instructs the Django to render the appropriate Template using that data

1. The `render()` function

- combines a given template with a context dictionary and returns an HttpResponse object with that rendered text.
- easiest way to generate HTML responses using templates
- signature: `render(request, template_name, context=None, content_type=None, status=None, using=None)`

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
def song_list(request):
    songs = Song.objects.all()  # Retrieve all songs from the database
    context = {'songs': songs}  # Context dictionary to pass to the template
    return render(request, 'songs/song_list.html', context)  # Render the template with context
```

2. Manual Rendering(Under the Hood)

- simple or non-HTML responses, you might manually load and render templates using `loader` and `HttpResponse`

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.template import loader
def song_list(request):
    songs = Song.objects.all()  # Retrieve all songs from the database
    template = loader.get_template('songs/song_list.html')  # Load the template
    context = {'songs': songs}  # Context dictionary to pass to the template
    rendered_template = template.render(context, request)  # Render the template with context
    return HttpResponse(rendered_template)  # Return an HttpResponse with the rendered content
```

### 📥 Template Loading

- process of locating and loading correct template file requested by the view

For `render(request, 'songs/song_list.html', context)`

- Check `TEMPLATES` setting in `settings.py` for directories to search
- Search in app-specific `templates/` directories if `APP_DIRS` is `True
- Load the template file if found, else raise `TemplateDoesNotExist` error

**Configuration** in `settings.py`

```python
# geetshala/settings.py
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...
        'APP_DIRS': True,  # Enable app-level templates directory
        ...
    },
]
```

### 🧱 Template Inheritance.

- allows you to create a base template that defines the base tempalte containing common elements(header, footer, navigation) and then have child templates override or fill in specific blocks of content

- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle

```html
<!-- base.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{% block title %} Welcome to Geetshala{% endblock %}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Welcome to Geetshala</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
      <!-- Navigation links -->
    </nav>
    <main>
      {% block content %}
      <!-- Default content can go here -->
      {% endblock %}
    </main>
    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2024 Geetshala</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

```html
<!-- child.html -->
{% extends "base.html" %} {% block title %}Home - Geetshala{% endblock %} {%
block content %}
<h2>List of Songs</h2>
<p>Top Songs</p>
{% endblock %}
```

#### Setting Up a Separate Database

??? note "Setting Up MySQL Database with Django"

    Install the MySQL Adapter for Django

    ```bash
    pip install mysqlclient
    ```
